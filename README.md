# Projects
A Selection of Programming Project that I have worked on since I have started programming.

Quantum K-Nearest Neighbours (2021)\
The project idea was to make a K-nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm, a commonly used classification algorithm in machine learning, in both classical computing as well as quantum computing and compare the run time speeds to see if there is an advantage of using quantum computing for this algorithm. Following the research paper in the folder, the quantum computing algorithm of KNN was created and tested on small number, as well as the classical computing algorithm. Will varying the size of the training data set, it was found that the quantum KNN did provide a speed up with bigger training data sets, and this is believe to be due to the use of superposition with the data set. Coded in python, in a juptyer notebook file.

Heart-At-Rest for Delta Hacks VII (2021)\
The project idea was to transition seniors from recording blood pressure data in journals to online. We created a mock online website to show our idea of how it would look alone with leveraging AI in order to run analysis on the data that would be inputted to detect things such as the risk of heart attacks in order to catch these potentially fatal events before they happen. We also came up with idea of extenting this project where the data would be shared with doctors immediately, with the paitents consent, so that doctors would be able to contact them if they think there are immediate problems and even be informed by the system if our AI believe the data should be reviewed, hopefully allowing for earlier detection of potentionally dangerous conditions.

Autonomocity for DeltaHacks VI (2020)\
The project idea was to use camera that would be around the city to take in data and send it to cars, to make it a connected city vs having autonomous cars that would be like little islands on their own. We would use this data that they would collect to detect things like slippery road conditions (black ice with AI), be able to dynamically change speed limits based on weather and time of day to better suit traffic and also be able to help drivers know when it is safe to turn on blind turns.

Eat Efficient for McMaster Engineering Competition (Python, Django)\
The project idea was to speed up checkout times in our cafeteria and also cut down on food waste. Our idea involves kiosks, portion size meters and algorithms, along with personalized order recommendations tailored to the user based on past orders and with facial recognition software for faster login times to the kiosk.

Anti Cargo Theft for Delta Hacks V(Python, Makefile, Latex, Doxygen)\
The program and project pitch of our idea to solve Canada Cartage's Challenge at the Delta Hacks V 2019. 
Below is a link to our project idea and the repo with our code and pitch.

Blazing Seal (C)\
This project is inspired by the Ninetendo Game Fire Emblem, called Blazing Seal complete with graphics. This is a turn based strategy game where users will select their characters and battle on a selected map which is graphically displayed. Including story mode and a 1 player vs CPU mode to the game is under development.

Flattening 2D Linked List (C)\
Randomly generates a 2D linked list that is in increasing order and flattens it into a singly linked list that is ordered in increasing order.

Photo Mutation Genetic Algorithm (C)\
Take in an image and modifies a randomly generated image using a genetic algorithm to mutate it into the inputted image.

Matrix Solver (C)\
This program randomly generates a matrix of a inputted size and determines whether the matrix is solvable or not and returns the solution matrix. This done by Gaussian Elmination. 

Bubble Sort Graphic (Assembly)\
An assembly project (NASM) graphically showing the steps taken when doing bubble sort on a randomized array of length 1-9 chosen by the user.

Wheel of Fortune (Python)\
This program is a implementation of the game Wheel Of Fortune with graphics to display score, letters that have been chosen and buttons to select letter. This game can be played in 1 - player mode vs a computer or 2 - player mode. Score are tracked for continious play to decide who is the best.

Triangle Classifier (Python)\
This program determines the area, type of triangle and more with given input of the coordinates of the vertices. This is done through implementation of mathematical knowledge such as Heron's formula.

Connect Four (Swift)\
This app was made for an Iphone X and is based off of Connect Four with the original game mode along with another game modde for the connect four game with different rules. This game allows you choose your character and keeps scores for multiple consecutive games.

Dating Application (Java, MySQL)\
This application is a dating application that would match users based on their anime likes. It is to help people who are less social find people who share similar interests based on their anime show that they watch. This application stores its users information in a SQL database, storing the anime shows that they watch along with their rating and their matches and location. This app uses Djikstra's shortest path algorithm with weighted pathes to find the people who are closest to each other and have the most in common to determine potential mates.
